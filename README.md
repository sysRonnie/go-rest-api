**Intro**

Hello.

Today is the first attempt at the deep working session on my application.

Welcome to the show :).

I think I am finally ready to program my first application.

I have been studying web development for about a year now.

I have built applications with React, Svelte, Angular and plain HTML.

I am now choosing to build my applications with Go.

This language has been super awesome. It has been really fun to learn and I am really excited about it.

I think this is super cool because I can point anything to this server and it will return JSON.

It doesn't matter what the front end client is.

I will be able to build one application.

This application will be a monolith.

Then, I can just hook up any front end interface.

Thats the easy part.

For now, I just need to get into a deep working groove and figure this thing out.

I am ready to formulate some new habits as a programmer.

I want to make good posture, and I want to enter the flow state.

The flow state is described as when you are directly at the cutoff point between System 1 thinking and System 2 thinking.

The uncounciously consious.

Its time to become great.

Let's keep learning.
